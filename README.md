Simply react app, made on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course. The goal with this app is just to tests my knowleges in React (useState Hook, conditional rendering, styling with styled components...). 

To run the app locally, simply git clone mine repository and run "npm install" in the first access and "npm start" everytime you want to run it.
